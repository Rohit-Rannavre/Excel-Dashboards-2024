### :zap: Vrinda Sales Dashboard
> **Objective**: The Vrinda Store aims to create a yearly sales report for 2022 to enable the store owner to gain insights into customer behavior and strategize for increased sales in 2023.

> **Questions:**
- Compare the sales and orders using a single chart to find out which month got the highest sales and orders?
- What are the top 5 states contributing to the sales?
- What is the relation between age and gender based on number of orders?
- Who made more purchases - men or women?
